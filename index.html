            <h3> I will show you how to find your style and love yourself through it.I've always loved fashion and style. Did you know on average a person makes 35,000 decisions per day? And you may not realise deciding what to wear is one of the most important daily decisions you make that helps you to express your self-identity.

    Through our clothing, we are able to non-verbally communicate a part of our personality. Whether that be expressing your sensitive side by wearing floral print or indicating youâ€™re an extravert by wearing an eye-catching statement piece.</h3>
